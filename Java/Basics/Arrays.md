# Arrays



## 3 steps to make an array.

1. declaration.
2. memory allocation.
3. initialisation.

## 3 ways to make Arrays.

1. all in one

in this method (all 3 steps)[https://github.com/manoharthakur351/just_for_u/blob/main/Java/Basics/Arrays.md#3-steps-to-make-an-array] are done at a time.
```
package manicrover;

public class Arry {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int[] marks = {1, 2};
    System.out.println(marks[1]);
  }
}

```

2. in this method first we declare a array then allocate it to a memory location and then finally we initialise it.
i.e. total 3 steps are done.

```
```



3. here in first step we declare and allocate an initialise in 2nd step.

**syntax**
```
<data type> [] <variable> = new <Data type>[<size of array>]
```

```
char[] pass = new char[3];
```
